# Todo List App 

Goal with this todo list app is to create my first fullstack application using Angular, Express, and a database. This todo list also using Angular Universal for server-side rendering which helps with SEO for the different pages and individual lists.

Throughout this project I have learned a lot in having to do with javascript (not just framework specific), backend development, and used mysql for the first time learning about database design in the process.
